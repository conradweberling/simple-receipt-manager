## SimpleReceiptManager
This project is a progressive web application to manage your receipts. The app is characterized by the low administrative effort. Additional users (e.g. roommates) can be invited simply by email. There is no user limit. Receipts can be easily entered with picture, date and total amount. A monthly cost breakdown can be found in the dashboard. Additionally, the app provides email notifications. For example, when a receipt is deleted by another user.
