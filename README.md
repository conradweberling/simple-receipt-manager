## SimpleReceiptManager
This project is a progressive web application to manage your receipts. The app is characterized by the low administrative overhead. Additional roommates can be invited simply by email. There is no user limit. Receipts can be easily entered with picture, date and total amount. A monthly overview of the cost breakdown can be found in the dashboard. In case of important events, users will be notified in the app and by email.

Demo 
------------
A demo can be found at https://srm.conradweberling.com/. There you can log in with the email `max@example.net` and the password `demodemo`. The data is reset half-hourly, so you can easily create or delete receipts. Email sending is disabled in the demo.
